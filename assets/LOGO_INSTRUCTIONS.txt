LOGO PLACEMENT INSTRUCTIONS
===========================

Place your AI Sync 101 logo in this folder.

Required:
---------
- Filename: logo.png
- Format: PNG with transparent background
- Recommended size: 400x400px minimum (will be scaled automatically)
- The logo should be the blue-to-pink gradient "A" with orbiting elements from your branding

The logo will be used in:
-------------------------
1. Navigation bar (scaled to 40px height)
2. Footer (scaled to 40px height, inverted to white for dark background)

Logo from your image:
--------------------
You provided an image at the start of our conversation.
Save that logo image as "logo.png" in this assets folder.

Temporary Placeholder:
---------------------
Until you add the logo, the site will show a broken image icon.
The layout and spacing are already configured correctly.

Alternative Formats:
-------------------
If you prefer SVG format for better scaling:
1. Save as logo.svg instead of logo.png
2. Update references in index.html:
   - Change <img src="assets/logo.png" to <img src="assets/logo.svg"
