SAVE YOUR LOGO HERE
===================

You shared two versions of your AI Sync 101 logo:

1. Logo WITH black background - for standalone use
2. Logo WITHOUT background (transparent) - for use on the website

TO ADD THE LOGO TO YOUR WEBSITE:
---------------------------------

1. Right-click on the logo image WITHOUT the black background
   (the one with transparent background that you shared)

2. Save it as: logo.png

3. Place it in THIS folder:
   /Users/crubi/Desktop/AI Sync 101 Website/ai-sync-101-website/assets/

4. Refresh your browser at http://localhost:8000

The logo will appear in:
- Navigation bar (top)
- Footer (bottom)

The dark theme website is now ready and will look great with your
blue-to-pink gradient logo!
