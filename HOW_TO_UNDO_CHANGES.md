# How to Undo Changes

## ✅ Easy Undo System

Every time I make changes, it's super easy to revert back!

## To Undo Dark Theme (Back to Light Theme)

I created a backup before making changes. To restore it:

```bash
cd "/Users/crubi/Desktop/AI Sync 101 Website/ai-sync-101-website"
cp css/styles.css.backup css/styles.css
```

Then refresh your browser (Cmd+R or F5).

## To Undo ANY Future Change

Just tell me:
- **"Undo that last change"**
- **"Go back to how it was before"**
- **"I don't like that, revert it"**

I can easily restore previous versions!

## Manual Undo (If Needed)

The backup file is at:
```
css/styles.css.backup
```

You can manually copy it over the main styles.css file anytime.

## Keep Track of Changes

Want me to create backups before each change? Just ask!
I can create dated backups like:
- `styles-2026-02-10-dark.css`
- `styles-2026-02-10-original.css`

## Quick Comparison

Want to see what changed? Tell me and I can show you:
- **"Show me what changed"**
- **"What's different from the original?"**

**Bottom line:** Nothing is permanent. Every change can be undone! 🔄
